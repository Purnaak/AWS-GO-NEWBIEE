# AWS-GO-NEWBIEE
Repository for GO-related 
Complete new file to identify changes
* Give contributor access to Anu

Basic Flow Steps:

* Pull the repository: https://github.com/bkaws/go-xbstream-tutorial
* Make a small change to the source code
* Commit your change with a meaningful message
    * When you go to the GitHub repo, can you see your changes? Why/why not?
* Add a new file to the source project and add content (can be a txt file)
* Make sure the new file is tracked by git
    * What command do you have to run to ensure the added file will be pushed to the git repo?
* Commit your new changes
* Push your changes to the repo
    * What command did you have to use?
* Add another file to the repository, but this time, make sure it is *not* going to be checked into the repository. There are files that are for local use only such as IDE settings or downloaded dependencies that we donâ€™t want to check into our source code repository. How do we accomplish this?

Merge Conflicts Steps:

* Make changes to file X
* Wait for your team member to also make changes to the same file and push their changes
* Try to commit and push your changes
    * What do you expect to happen?
    * What actually happened?
* In your IDE, resolve the merge conflict
* Commit and push your changes
